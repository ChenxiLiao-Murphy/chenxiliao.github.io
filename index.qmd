Hi, My name is Murphy Liao, and I approach travel with the same mindset I bring to my work in business and risk management: a deep curiosity, attention to detail, and a genuine desire to understand how things function beneath the surface. I don’t just visit new places—I explore them thoughtfully, seeking to understand their cultural, social, and economic dynamics.

Whether navigating the vibrant energy of a major city or the quiet rhythms of a smaller town, I’m drawn to the intersection of design, innovation, and daily life. I find inspiration in local architecture, small business models, and community stories, always looking for what makes a place unique and how it reflects broader global patterns.

My travels are often a blend of structured planning and spontaneous discovery. I enjoy connecting with locals, trying new experiences, and reflecting on what each journey teaches me—not just as a tourist, but as someone constantly growing both personally and professionally.
